// One morning, Polycarp woke up and realized that 1543
//  is the most favorite number in his life.

// The first thing that Polycarp saw that day as soon as he opened his eyes was a large wall carpet of size n
//  by m
//  cells; n
//  and m
//  are even integers. Each cell contains one of the digits from 0
//  to 9
// .

// Polycarp became curious about how many times the number 1543
//  would appear in all layers∗
//  of the carpet when traversed clockwise.

// ∗
// The first layer of a carpet of size n×m
//  is defined as a closed strip of length 2⋅(n+m−2)
//  and thickness of 1
//  element, surrounding its outer part. Each subsequent layer is defined as the first layer of the carpet obtained by removing all previous layers from the original carpet.

// Input
// The first line of the input contains a single integer t
//  (1≤t≤100
// ) — the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases.

// The first line of each test case contains a pair of numbers n
//  and m
//  (2≤n,m≤103
// , n,m
//  — even integers).

// This is followed by n
//  lines of length m
// , consisting of digits from 0
//  to 9
//  — the description of the carpet.

// It is guaranteed that the sum of n⋅m
//  across all test cases does not exceed 106
// .

// Output
// For each test case, output a single number — the total number of times 1543
//  appears in all layers of the carpet in the order of traversal clockwise
